QuadraTot
===============

QuadraTot is a project for Cornell's Artificial Intelligence class,
[CS 4700](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4700/2010fa/), by
Diana Hidalgo, Sarah Nguyen, and [Jason
Yosinski](http://yosinski.com/).

Code includes several learning algorithms, motion models, and robot
abstraction using
[pydynamixel](http://code.google.com/p/pydynamixel/).  The project's
[Trac site](http://quadratot.yosinski.com/) is also a good resource.

See also the [Aracna](http://creativemachines.cornell.edu/aracna) open source robot, for which [3D design files](https://github.com/yosinski/aracnaHardware) and [drivers](https://github.com/CreativeMachinesLab/aracna) are also available.
